# credit_card_fraud_detection

Welcome to the capstone project on Credit Card Fraud Detection.

Although digital transactions in India registered a 51% growth in 2018–2019, their safety remains a concern. Fraudulent activities have increased severalfold, with approximately 52,304 cases of credit/debit card fraud reported in FY 2019 alone. Owing to this steep increase in banking frauds, it is the need of the hour to detect these fraudulent transactions in time to help consumers and banks that are losing their credit worth each day. Machine learning can play a vital role in detecting fraudulent transactions.

The problem statement chosen for this project is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions with the help of machine learning models.

In this project, we will analyse customer-level data that has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group. 

The data set includes credit card transactions made by European cardholders over a period of two days in September 2013. Out of a total of 2,84,807 transactions, 492 were fraudulent. This data set is highly unbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for 0.172% of the total transactions. The data set has also been modified with principal component analysis (PCA) to maintain confidentiality. Apart from ‘time’ and ‘amount’, all the other features (V1, V2, V3, up to V28) are the principal components obtained using PCA. The feature 'time' contains the seconds elapsed between the first transaction in the data set and the subsequent transactions. The feature 'amount' is the transaction amount. The feature 'class' represents class labelling, and it takes the value of 1 in cases of fraud and 0 in others.
